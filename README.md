# CodeFactory.Markup.Adapter
Adapter pattern used for conversion of markup base content in code factory conversions.  The final output is published as a Nuget Package which makes available the adapter pattern interfaces and base classes to implementing authors.

## New to CodeFactory?
In the simplest terms, CodeFactory is a real time software factory that is triggered from inside Visual Studio during the design and construction of software. CodeFactory allows for development staff to automate repetitive development tasks that take up developerâ€™s time.

Please see the following link for further information and guidance about the [CodeFactory Runtime](https://github.com/CodeFactoryLLC/CodeFactory) or the [CodeFactory SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeFactorySDK/).
